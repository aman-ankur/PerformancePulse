## User Experience Design

### Manager Dashboard Philosophy: "Team Oversight, Not Employee Surveillance"

**Team Overview Dashboard**
Think Linear team view meets GitHub insights:
- Team member cards with recent activity summaries
- Consent status indicators for each data source
- Upcoming 1:1 schedule with preparation status
- Team-wide activity trends and collaboration patterns
- Quick access to meeting preparation for each team member

**Individual Team Member Profile**
Think GitHub profile meets performance context:
- Evidence timeline showing technical contributions over time
- Historical context documents with correlation highlights
- Pattern recognition showing consistent strengths and growth areas
- Meeting preparation history with manager feedback
- Consent management interface for data source permissions

**Meeting Preparation Interface**
Think Notion document meets AI assistant:
- Configuration panel for meeting type, timeframe, and focus areas
- AI-generated preparation with evidence correlation analysis
- Historical pattern recognition with specific examples
- Structured discussion points with suggested conversation starters
- Export options for PDF or Markdown meeting notes

### Interaction Patterns

**Evidence Correlation Intelligence**
AI-powered correlation between current work and historical context:
- "How does Sarah's recent GitLab work relate to her Q3 goals from our last review?"
- "What patterns emerge from John's technical contributions over the past 6 months?"
- "Generate discussion points for Maria's quarterly review based on recent evidence"
- "What historical context is relevant for discussing Alex's career progression?"

**Historical Context Integration**
Seamless integration of uploaded documents with current evidence:
- Drag-and-drop document upload with automatic processing
- AI extraction of themes, goals, and feedback from historical documents
- Temporal correlation showing how current work relates to past discussions
- Pattern recognition across multiple performance conversations

**Privacy-First Workflows**
Consent management integrated into every data operation:
- Clear consent requests with specific data scope explanations
- Granular controls for each data source (GitLab, Jira, documents)
- Easy consent revocation with immediate data deletion
- Transparent audit trails showing what data was processed when
