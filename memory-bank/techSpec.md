- Automatic categorization and relevance scoring
- Vector embeddings for semantic search and correlation
- Rich metadata for filtering and analysis

**AI-Generated Insights**
- Strengths, improvement areas, achievements automatically identified
- Confidence scoring for all AI-generated content
- Human validation and editing capabilities

### Interaction Patterns

**Conversational Intelligence**
Natural language queries that feel like chatting with an intelligent assistant:
- "How is Sarah progressing on her Q4 goals?"
- "What evidence do I have for technical leadership?"
- "Generate talking points for John's 1:1 this week"
- "What are the biggest risks on my team right now?"

**Real-time Collaboration**
Google Docs-style collaborative editing for reviews:
- Live cursors showing who's editing what
- Comment threads on specific sections
- Suggestion mode for manager feedback
- Real-time notifications for updates

**Smart Automation**
AI that works in the background without being intrusive:
- Automatic evidence discovery from integrated systems
- Proactive insights about team dynamics and performance
- Smart reminders for review deadlines and 1:1 prep
- Intelligent content suggestions during review writing
