# PerformancePulse - Updated Development Roadmap
## LLM-Enhanced Evidence Correlation for Performance Conversations

## Philosophy: "Manager-First, Evidence-Driven with AI Enhancement"

Build a specialized tool that solves one problem exceptionally well: helping managers prepare for performance conversations with LLM-enhanced evidence correlation, organized factual evidence, and semantic relationship insights. Focus on immediate value and clean user experience powered by intelligent correlation.
