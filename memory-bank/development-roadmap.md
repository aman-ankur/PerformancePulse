## Simplified Data Model (Manager-Focused)

```sql
-- Core tables for manager workflow
team_members (id, name, email, role, level, manager_id)
data_consents (id, team_member_id, source_type, consented)
evidence_items (id, team_member_id, source, title, content, category, evidence_date)
context_documents (id, team_member_id, document_type, content, key_themes, date_range)
meeting_preparations (id, team_member_id, meeting_type, timeframe, generated_content)
sync_jobs (id, team_member_id, source_type, status, last_run_at)
```
