3. **Team Performance Metrics** - Real-time dashboard

#### **Day 3-4: LLM Integration UI**
1. **Cost Monitoring Dashboard** - Display LLM usage/budget
2. **Correlation Pipeline Controls** - Toggle LLM enhancement
3. **Semantic Insights Display** - Show LLM-discovered relationships

#### **Day 5: Testing & Polish**
1. **End-to-end testing** with real data
2. **Performance optimization**
3. **Demo preparation**

### **Priority 2: Production Deployment (1-2 days)**
1. **Environment Configuration** - Add LLM API keys
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated deployment
3. **Monitoring Setup** - Cost tracking alerts

3. **Add basic LLM correlation** - Semantic understanding capability
4. **Build evidence browser UI** - Makes data accessible to managers

### **Success Metrics**
- **Technical:** 100% test pass rate, <5s evidence collection
- **User Experience:** <30 minute meeting prep, PDF export working  
- **Business:** <$20/month total cost, 3 team members onboarded
- **Quality:** Real data flowing, no mock data in production

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Database issues:** Have fallback to local SQLite for development
- **LLM costs:** Hard budget limits with rule-based fallback
- **Data quality:** Comprehensive validation and error handling
- **User adoption:** Focus on manager workflow optimization

## 📝 **CONCLUSION**

PerformancePulse has **excellent technical foundations** with a sophisticated correlation engine and solid architecture. The project is **95% complete on the backend** with impressive algorithm implementations and test coverage.

**Key Insight:** We're not starting from scratch - we have a working correlation system that just needs to be connected to the user interface through proper database configuration and API integration.

**Path to Success:** Fix the database connection (1 day), implement API endpoints (1 day), add LLM integration (2-3 days), and build the manager dashboard (3-4 days). This gets us to a working MVP within 7-10 days.

The **correlation algorithms are already working** - we just need to make them accessible through the web interface. This is primarily an integration challenge rather than an algorithmic one, which significantly de-risks the timeline.

**Next Action:** Start with database configuration to unblock the 8 failing integration tests, then proceed through the phased approach outlined above.
