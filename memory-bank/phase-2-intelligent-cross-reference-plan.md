# Phase 2.1: Intelligent Cross-Reference Detection
## Advanced Correlation Engine Implementation Plan

**Status:** Ready to Start  
**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Build On:** Phase 1.2.3 Unified Evidence Service  
**Goal:** Automatically detect and link related evidence across GitLab and JIRA

---

## 🎯 **PHASE OVERVIEW**

### **Problem We're Solving**
Currently, our system collects evidence from GitLab (commits, MRs) and JIRA (tickets) independently. Managers need to see **how development work connects to business requirements** - which commits solve which tickets, what work happened for each sprint goal, etc.

### **Solution Architecture**
Build an intelligent correlation engine that:
1. **Links Commits → JIRA Tickets** via issue keys, branch names, content analysis
2. **Groups Related Work** into coherent "work stories" 
3. **Scores Confidence** of relationships (0.0-1.0)
4. **Detects Patterns** in work sequences and technology usage
5. **Provides Manager Insights** on team productivity and work quality

---

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Components**

```python
# New correlation engine components:
src/services/correlation_engine.py      # Main correlation orchestration
src/models/correlation_models.py       # Correlation data models
src/algorithms/
├── jira_gitlab_linker.py              # GitLab-JIRA linking logic
├── confidence_scorer.py               # Relationship confidence scoring
├── work_story_grouper.py              # Group related evidence
├── timeline_analyzer.py               # Temporal pattern detection
└── technology_detector.py             # Tech stack identification

# Enhanced existing components:
src/services/unified_evidence_service.py  # Add correlation pipeline
src/models/unified_evidence.py            # Add correlation metadata
```

### **Data Flow Enhancement**

```
Current: GitLab Evidence + JIRA Evidence → Unified Collection
Phase 2: GitLab Evidence + JIRA Evidence → Correlation Engine → Enhanced Collection
                                        ↓
                                    Work Stories + Confidence Scores + Tech Insights
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Caching**: Cache correlation results for repeated queries
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple evidence items efficiently
- **Incremental Updates**: Only recompute correlations for new evidence

### **Scalability**
- **Async Processing**: Use asyncio for concurrent analysis
- **Memory Management**: Stream processing for large datasets
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient storage of correlation metadata

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality if correlation fails
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only show high-confidence relationships
- **Fallback Strategies**: Manual correlation hints if automatic detection fails
