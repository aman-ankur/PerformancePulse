# PerformancePulse: Performance Data Aggregation Assistant

## Product Vision

> "From 3 days to 30 minutes: AI-powered data aggregation that transforms scattered engineering contributions into organized, factual summaries for better performance conversations"

A focused data aggregation tool that helps engineering managers prepare for 1:1s, performance reviews, and career discussions by automatically collecting and organizing technical contributions from multiple sources, while integrating historical context from meeting notes and past discussions.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge:
Engineering managers spend 2-3 days per performance review manually collecting data from:

* **GitLab**: commits, merge requests, code reviews, project contributions
* **Jira**: tickets, sprint performance, project delivery, collaboration patterns
* **Historical Context**: past meeting notes, 1:1 summaries, performance discussions
* **Manual Documents**: meeting transcripts, Slack threads, team feedback
* **Cross-System Correlation**: matching tickets to code changes, timeline analysis

### Business Impact:

* **Time Cost:** 20+ manager-days per quarter for a team of 8
* **Quality Issues:** Recency bias, incomplete data, missing historical context
* **Scalability Problem:** Doesn't scale with team growth or meeting frequency
* **Context Loss:** Past discussions and patterns get forgotten or overlooked
* **Preparation Stress:** Managers feel unprepared for important career conversations
