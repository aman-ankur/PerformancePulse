# PerformancePulse: Performance Data Aggregation Assistant

## Product Vision

> "From 3 days to 30 minutes: AI-powered data aggregation that transforms scattered engineering contributions into organized, factual summaries"

A data aggregation assistant that helps managers and team members quickly gather factual performance data from engineering systems, providing context and organization while requiring explicit user consent and leaving interpretation to humans.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge:
Engineering managers and team members spend 2-3 days per performance review manually collecting data from:

* GitLab commits, merge requests, code reviews
* Jira tickets, sprint performance, project delivery
* Documentation and knowledge sharing platforms
* Communication tools and collaboration patterns
* Self-assessments and peer feedback documents

### Business Impact:

* **Time Cost:** 20+ manager-days per quarter for a team of 8
* **Quality Issues:** Recency bias, incomplete data, inconsistent evaluation
* **Scalability Problem:** Doesn't scale with team growth
* **Compliance Risk:** Inconsistent documentation and evidence

    * **Contribution Logging:** Factual achievements and project data

2.  **AI-Powered Data Organization**
    * **Multi-Source Correlation:** Technical contributions across systems
    * **Pattern Recognition:** Contribution types, project involvement, trends
    * **Goal Alignment Tracking:** Progress against objectives with factual data
    * **Context Provision:** Organized summaries, not performance judgments

3.  **Manager Interface**
    * **Team Dashboard:** Data collection status, contribution summaries
    * **Individual Profiles:** Comprehensive contribution portfolio
    * **Natural Language Queries:** "Show me Sarah's technical contributions this quarter"
    * **Data Summaries:** Organized factual reports with source citations

4.  **Data Export & Reports**
    * **Contribution Summaries:** Achievement summaries with source data
    * **Factual Reports:** Organized data for performance discussions
    * **Audit Trail:** Complete data source traceability
    * **Export Capabilities:** PDF, structured data formats
